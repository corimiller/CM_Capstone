### Abstract
Despite progress in gender equity, gaps persist in higher education outcomes. This study investigates the relationship between gender ratios and graduation rates using mixed-methods, combining data from The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) with machine learning models. While gender ratios correlate with graduation rates, predictive modeling results are inconclusive, suggesting the influence of other factors. Future research should explore the intersection of gender ratios with other demographic factors to better understand gender gaps in higher education.
